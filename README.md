# AI Anime Recommendation Tool

## A quick project built to help me practice with React and Tailwind.

### Built w/ React + Vite, OpenAI API, Kitsu's Anime API and TailwindCSS

Have any friends reach out to your asking for anime recommendations but can't be bothered to figure out what they like?

With this web, you can easily take your friend's favorite anime and give them back a few options with the reason why it was recommended and what it's all about!

## TODOs

There are a few improvements I would like to make:
- Update ChatGPT logic to be under a `useChatGPT` hook or something like that
- Better UX
    - Update anime images to react to input interactions
    - A different loading presentation
    - Overall styling update.
- Add where each anime is streaming with a link to those sites
- Maybe hook up to `myanimelist`?

## How do you run me?

Run the app locally
```npm run dev```
